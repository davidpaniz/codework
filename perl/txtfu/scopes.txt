Scopes
======
    Names are stored in 2 possible ways:

Symbol tables
-------------
    - Global hashes that store global variable names
    - the same as a package

Lexical Scopes
--------------
    - Unnamed scratchpads attached to a block of code.
    - Not attached to any pachage
    - 'my' declares and attaches a variable to a lexical scope.
    - 'our' creates an alias to a package variable to be used inside
      the current lexical scope. ('our' permit access to global varables)

So, a namespace can be global or lexical.

    my $x    # confines name and value to a scope. New name and new value. Private variable.
    our $y   # confines name           to a scope. Declares (presents) a global variable in my scope.
    local $z # confines          value to a scope. Temporary inside my scope. Value is restored after scope.

Dynamical Scopes
----------------
    # - blocks nest dynamically by calling other blocks
    # - first BLOCK variables can be seen by 2nd block, because 2nd block is an 'enclosed' block
    #   at runtime, i.e., a subroutine can see the caller's lexicals

Typeglobs
=========
    $foo    - scalar
    @foo    - array
    %foo    - hash
    &foo    - subroutine
    foo:    - label
    foo     - filehandle
    *foo    - all things 'foo' inside this namespace

    - assigning to a typeglob is how Module imports work in Perl.
