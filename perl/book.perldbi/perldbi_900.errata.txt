     	next unless unpack( "A64", $_ ) eq $siteName;


{20} The line

	substr( $_, 64+64, 16, pack( "A16", $siteMapRef ) );

     	substr($_, 64+64, 16) = pack( "A16", $siteMapRef ) );


{72} "IN =" now reads "IN".


{75} last paragraph:
On the second line from the bottom, it did read CREATETABLE; it now reads 
CREATE TABLE. One space in between.

{304} "Stored Procedures"
The first code example:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("BEGIN foo(:1, :2) END;");

now reads:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("BEGIN foo(:1, :2); END;");

Similarly, the second code example:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("BEGIN :result = func_name(:id, :changeme) END;");

now reads:

  $sth = $dbh->prepare("BEGIN :result = func_name(:id, :changeme); END;");
