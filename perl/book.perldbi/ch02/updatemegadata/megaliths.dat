Lundin Links:Fife & Central:NO 404 027:Standing Stones:Three gnarled and twisted sandstone pillars stand on a golf course in Lundin Links. Each stone stands approximately 5 metres tall potentially forming the remains of a massive four-poster.
Stonehenge:Wiltshire:SU 123 400:Stone Circle:The most popularly known stone circle in the world without a shadow of a doubt. This is a complex site with a known sequence of creation and re-design over a period of 3000 years from a simple timber ring and ditch to the massive trilithons and henge seen today.
Castlerigg:Cumbria:NY 291 236:Stone Circle:One of the loveliest stone circles remaining today. This site is comprised of large rounded boulders set within a natural amphitheatre formed by surrounding hills.
Balbirnie:Fife & Central:NO 285 030:Stone Circle:Lovely stone circle with internal cists. Unfortunately, due to widening of the nearby A92 road, the stone circle was moved from its original site to its present location in Balbirnie Park. Not immediately obvious to the observer, but this is quite an important site within a large prehistoric complex ( including Balfarg Henge ) which is now ravaged. The trials and tribulations of this circle still aren't over, as a brand new housing estate has been built within about 200 yards of the circle. An access road to this estate runs right beside the edge of the circle. Unfortunately, recently it appears that someone missed the turning a little and ploughed into the fence erected around the site. Luckily, they missed the stones themselves! However, the site has become a magnet for rubbish, ruining any ambience it once had.
Orwell:Fife & Central:NO 149 043:Standing Stones:Two deceptively large monoliths standing in a field. From the road, they don't look their size which is both around 8-9 ft tall. The western stone is quite jagged is appearance whereas the eastern stone is smoother.
