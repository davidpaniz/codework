Here's a key to the markup:

        [page-number]: serious technical mistake
        {page-number}: minor technical mistake
        <page-number>: important language/formatting problem
        (page-number): language change or minor formatting problem
        ?page-number?: reader question or request for clarification


Confirmed errors:


(v) 8th bullet;
DBD::MySql should be DBD::mSQL.

(xiii)  first link under "Resources";
http://www.symbolstone.org/technology/perl/DBI  has been moved to dbi.perl.org

"The DBI pages have permanently moved to: dbi.perl.org. Please update your bookmarks and links. This redirection page will not exist indefinitely."

(xvi) last paragraph:
"reviewers to gave us" should be "reviewers that gave us"


{13} code:

	### Remove the newline that acts as a record delimiter chop;

should be

	### Remove the newline that acts as a records delimiter chomp;


{20} The line

	substr( $_, 64+64, 16, pack( "A16", $siteMapRef ) );

should read:
	
     	substr($_, 64+64, 16) = pack( "A16", $siteMapRef );

(Remove second parenthesis).


[36] code section "### Insert some data rows":

	$database{'Callanish I'} =
            "This site, commonly known as the "Stonehenge of the North" is in 
	the form of a buckled celtic cross.";

The inner quotes should be two separate opening single quote characters and 
then two separate closing single quote characters. In the book that's been 
rendered as double quotes. That's wrong.


(70) 1st paragraph:
On the third line, the word "and" appears twice. Remove one "and".


<82> 2nd-to-last paragraph, last sentence;

The text reads:

    Because DBI dies if it can't load an initialize a driver, this method 
    should be called inside an eval{} block if you need to catch that error.

"eval{} block" is in constant width font. "eval {}" should remain in constant 
width font, but block should be in normal body font.


[84] table:
order of arguments for an mSQL connect is written as :

	dbi:mSQL:hostname:database:port_number,

It should be

	dbi:mSQL:database:hostname:port_number.


[117] line 2:
The Perl code line reads:
   
	$rows = $sth->dump_results( 80, '\n', ';', \*FILE );

It should be changed to:
   
	$rows = $sth->dump_results( 80, "\n", ';', \*FILE );


(119)  6th paragraph;

"The second and subsequent itterations..."

"itterations" should be "iterations"


(123) last paragraph:

	executing four different SQL statements within the 
	database

"four different SQL" should read "three different SQL".


(131) 2nd paragraph, 6th line:

	to select the name and type fields

"type" should read "mapref".


{131} second paragraph under "Batch Fetching":
The last sentence of the paragraph ("They are invoked...statement handle") 
should be removed.


(133) 10th line:
 
	for the rows name and location

"rows" should read "columns".


{165} 2nd-to-last SELECT statement:
The "outer" CONCAT is missing a comma between its two arguments.


(167) fourth non-indented paragraph:
In the text "and search for SQLGetInfo returns", the entire word "returns"
should be in constant width font.


(170) footnote:
Footnote should say: "They are available from..." because there are two 
[portable Open Source driver managers].


(179) Setting up a proxy server:

	...since PPM currently does not currently support bundles...

One of the "currently"s should be removed.


(195) 7th line from the bottom:
"bind_column" should read "bind_columns".


(213) last paragraph of "table (NEW)":

	Note that table_info might not return records for all 
	tables.

"table_info" should read "tables".


(228) NUM_OF_PARAMS (integer, read-only):
There is no "Substitution Variables" to refer to anywhere in this book.


(230)  3rd paragraph; 

The last sentence reads:

It's use is not recommended.

It should read:

Its use is not recommended.


(281) FLOAT(M,D):

	Allowable values are -3.402823466e+38 to -1.175494351e-38, 
	0 and -1.175494351e-38 to 3.40282346 6e+38.

should read:

	Allowable values are -3.402823466e+38 to -1.175494351e-38, 
	0 and 1.175494351e-38 to 3.402823466e+38.


(298) 4th paragraph from the bottom:

	The NUMBER datatype stores positive and negative fixed 
	and floating-point numbers with magnitudes between 1.0 
	* 10-130 and 9.9...9 * 10125 (38 nines followed by 88 
	zeroes), with 38 digits of precision.

In "1.0 * 10-130", "-130" should be superscripted because it is the -130th 
power of 10.

In "9.9...9 * 10125",  "125" should be superscripted because it is the 125th 
power of 10.


{310} string matching operators table:
The last example, for the glyph '!~*', reads:

 	'thomas' !~ '.*vadim.*'

but should be:
 
	'thomas' !~* '.*vadim.*'


(316)  7th paragraph; The text reads: "SearchServer does not really supports 
joins, however it does support a kind of view mechanism."

"supports" should be replaced by "support"
