# Local Drag and Drop demonstration. This program allows one to drag
# items from one Canvas to another.
#
# There are two basic types of DND operations, local (intra-application)
# and remote (inter-application). Local drops are fully supported, but
# there is no standard for remote drops. For this reason, this article
# describes only local DND operations. For the record, Perl/Tk supports
# Sun, XDND, KDE and Win32 remote DND protocols. Perhaps a future
# article will discus this issue.
#
# To write DND code we need to be familiar with these concepts:
#
# 1) The drag source is the widget that we drag.  In the case of
#    a Canvas widget, we can arrange for an individual item to
#    be the drag source.
#
# 2) The drop destination is the widget upon which we drop the
#    source widget.
#
# 3) The DND token is a Label widget which tracks the cursor as
#    it moves from the drag source to the drop destination. We
#    can configure the DND token with a text string or image.

$mw = MainWindow->new(-background => 'green');

# The drag source - a Canvas full of items. Here we declare that a
# <B1-Motion> event over the source Canvas signals the start of a
# local drag operation.
#
# $drag_source is a Tk::DragDrop object, sometimes called a DND token.
# It's really a disguised Label widget, which we can configure in the
# standard fashion. For our purposes, we set the -text option to
# describe the Canvas item we are dragging, rather than the default
# text of the source widget's class name. But you can assign an image
# to the DND token if desired.
#
# When performing a DND operation, notice that the DND token has a
# flat relief over the source, and a sunken relief over the destination.

my $drag_source = $c_src->DragDrop(
    -event     => '<B1-Motion>',

);

# Every Canvas source item has a <ButtonPress-1> binding associated
# with it. The callback bound to this event serves to record the item's
# id in the global variable $drag_id, and to configure the drag Label's
# -text option with the item's id and type.

my $press = sub {
    my ($c_src, $c_src_id, $drag_source) = @_;

    $drag_source->configure(-text => $c_src_id . " = $type");

# Okay, let's populate the source Canvas with items of various types.
# For this demonstration, we limit the choices to images, ovals and
# rectangles. As noted earlier, every item gets a <ButtonPress-1>
# binding.

# These subroutines are invoked when a Canvas source item is dropped on

# $c_dest = destiantion Canvas widget reference
# $sel    = selection type, here "XdndSelection"
# $dest_x = Canvas drop site X coordinate
# $dest_y = Canvas drop site Y coordinate
#
# The first two arguments we supplied on the -dropcommand option. The
# remaining arguments are implicitly supplied by Perl/Tk.
#
# *move_items* simply branches according to the item's type, throwing
# an error for Canvas items we are not prepared to handle. Each type
# handler recieves the preceeding arguments plus the item's type.

# Subroutine *make_bindings* establishes local bindings on the

# Subroutine *make_bindings* adds drag behavior to our newly dropped
# Canvas items, but without using the DND mechanism. The basic idea
# goes as follows:
#
# On a <ButtonPress-1> event, record the Canvas item's (x,y)
# coordinates in instance variables of the form "x" . $id and
# "y" . $id, where $id is the item's Canvas id.  This ensures
# that each item's position is uniquely maintained.
#
# On a <ButtonRelease-1> event, compute an (x,y) delta from the
# item's orignal position (stored in instance variables) and the
# new postion, and use the Canvas *move* method to relocate it.

sub make_bindings {

    my ($c_dest, $id) = @_;

    $c_dest->bind($id, '<ButtonPress-1>' => [sub {
    my ($c, $id) = @_;
    ($c_dest->{'x' . $id}, $c_dest->{'y' . $id}) =
        ($Tk::event->x, $Tk::event->y);
    }, $id]);

    $c_dest->bind($id, '<ButtonRelease-1>' => [sub {
    my ($c, $id) = @_;
    my($x, $y) = ($Tk::event->x, $Tk::event->y);
    $c->move($id, $x - $c_dest->{'x' . $id}, $y - $c_dest->{'y' . $id});
    }, $id]);

} # end make_bindings
