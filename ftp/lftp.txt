mirror [OPTS] [source [target]]

       Mirror  specified source directory to local target directory. If target directory ends with a
       slash, the source base name is appended to target directory name. Source and/or target can be
       URLs pointing to directories.

            -R,    --reverse                 reverse mirror (put files)
            -L,    --dereference             download symbolic links as files
            -N,    --newer-than=SPEC         download only files newer than specified time
                   --on-change=CMD           execute the command if anything has been changed
                   --older-than=SPEC         download only files older than specified time
                   --size-range=RANGE        download only files with size in specified range

                   --use-pget[-n=N]          use pget to transfer every single file
                   --loop                    loop until no changes found
            -i RX, --include RX              include matching files
            -x RX, --exclude RX              exclude matching files
            -I GP, --include-glob GP         include matching files
            -X GP, --exclude-glob GP         exclude matching files
            -v,    --verbose[=level]         verbose operation
                   --log=FILE                write lftp commands being executed to FILE
                   --script=FILE             write lftp commands to FILE, but don't execute them
                   --just-print, --dry-run   same as --script=-
                   --use-cache               use cached directory listings
                   --Remove-source-files     remove files after transfer (use with caution)
            -a                               same as --allow-chown --allow-suid --no-umask

       When  using  -R, the first directory is local and the second is remote.  If the second direc‐
       tory is omitted, base name of first directory is used.  If both directories are omitted, cur‐
       rent  local  and  remote directories are used.  If target directory ends with a slash (except
       root directory) then base name of source directory is appended.

       RX is an extended regular expression, just like in egrep(1).

       GP is a glob pattern, e.g. `*.zip'.

       Include and exclude options can be specified multiple times. It means that a file  or  direc‐
       tory  would  be  mirrored  if  it matches an include and does not match to excludes after the
       include, or does not match anything and the first check is exclude. Directories  are  matched
       with a slash appended.

       Note  that symbolic links are not created when uploading to remote server, because ftp proto‐
       col cannot do it. To upload files the links refer to, use `mirror -RL'  command  (treat  sym‐
       bolic links as files).

       For options --newer-than and --older-than you can either specify a file or time specification
       like that used by at(1) command, e.g.  `now-7days' or `week ago'. If you specify a file, then
       modification time of that file will be used.

       Verbosity  level  can be selected using --verbose=level option or by several -v options, e.g.
       -vvv. Levels are:
            0 - no output (default)
            1 - print actions
            2 - +print not deleted file names (when -e is not specified)
            3 - +print directory names which are mirrored

       --only-newer turns off file size comparison and uploads/downloads only newer  files  even  if
       size is different. By default older files are transferred and replace newer ones.

       You  can  mirror between two servers if you specify URLs instead of directories.  FXP is used
       automatically for transfers between ftp servers, if possible.

       Some ftp servers hide dot-files by default (e.g. .htaccess), and show  them  only  when  LIST
       command is used with -a option. In such case try to use `set ftp:list-options -a'.
