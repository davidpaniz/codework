Basic authentication
    - same authentication database for multiple realms


Digest authentication
    - encoding of the realm with the credentials
    - must have separate credentials database for each realm

Directives:
    Files:  every file named "foo.html" on the tree.
    Directory: directory named inside DocumentRoot (?)
    Location: url component inside webspace
              depending on 'alias' configuration, a Location
              can be named diferently from its actual directory
Controls:
    DAC: Discretionary Access Control
         "at the discretion of the user", i.e., supplied by the user
    MAC: Mandatory Access Control
         Indepent of the user, cannot be changed by the user
         Ex: dna, subnet,
    Discretionary: Require
                    Error -> not authorized
    Mandatory    : Allow,Deny
                    Error -> forbidden

    Satisfy:
        All - must be inside net 10. and have a password
        Any - free for net 10. Other acesses must have a password
#
    <Files foo.html>
        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from All
        Allow from [10.0.0.0/255.0.0.0]

        AuthName "Insiders Only"
        AuthType [Basic|Digest]
        AuthUserFile /usr/local/web/apache/.htpasswd-foo
        Require valid-user

        Satisfy Any

IP Adresses

    - partial addr: 10  10.1  192.168   172.20   10.11
    - addr/subnet:  10.11.32.0/255.255.255.0
    - addr/cidr:    10.11.32.0/24

Order:
    Order Allow,Deny:
        - Deny from all
        - Allow from []
    Order Deny,Allow:

        - Deny from [].
    Order mutual-failure
        - !


Allowing Users to Control Access to Their Own Documents

    - per-directory .htaccess files
    - However, in order for Apache to pay attention to them, the directories in question need to be within the scope of a AllowOverride directive that includes the AuthConfig (for discretionary controls) or Limit (for mandatory controls) keywords.

    For instance, a standard Linux installation of Apache can enable this with the following lines in the httpd.conf file:

    <Directory /home/*/public_html>
        AllowOverride AuthConfig Limit
    </Directory>

Preventing use of .htaccess:

    <Directory />
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

Protecting FileSystem:

    # Deny root first:
    <Directory />
        Order Deny,Allow
        Deny from all
    </Directory>

    # Open specific directories as needed:
    <Directory /usr/users/*/public_html>
        Order Deny,Allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
    <Directory /usr/local/httpd>
        Order Deny,Allow
        Allow from all
    </Directory>

    # Prevent mis-access
    <Files ~ "^\.ht">
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
    </Files>

    # File and dir
    # /var/web/dir1/*/*/private.html
    #
    <Directory /var/web/dir1>
        <Files private.html>
            Order allow,deny
            Deny from all
        </Files>
    </Directory>

    # Image regex
    <FilesMatch \.(?i:gif|jpe?g|png)$>
        Order allow,deny
        Deny from all
    </FilesMatch>

Caution:

    <Location />
        Order deny,allow
        Allow from all
    </Location>

    # Woops! This <Directory> section will have no effect
    <Directory />  jj
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        Deny from badguy.example.com
    </Directory>

cgi-bin:
    <Directory /home/httpd/cgi-bin>
        Options FollowSymLinks
        Order allow,deny
        Allow from all
    </Directory>
