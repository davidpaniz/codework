           will run with effective gid set to the gid of the file owner.

  4000    (the set-user-ID-on-execution bit) Executable files with this bit set
           will run with effective uid set to the uid of the file owner.  Directo-
           ries with the set-user-id bit set will force all files and sub-directo-
           ries created in them to be owned by the directory owner and not by the
           uid of the creating process, if the underlying file system supports
           this feature: see chmod(2) and the suiddir option to mount(8).
