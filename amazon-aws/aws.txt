==> Caveats
Before you can use these tools you must export some variables to your $SHELL
and download your X.509 certificate and private key from Amazon Web Services.

Your certificate and private key are available at:
http://aws-portal.amazon.com/gp/aws/developer/account/index.html?action=access-key

Download two ".pem" files, one starting with `pk-`, and one starting with `cert-`.
You need to put both into a folder in your home directory, `~/.ec2`.

To export the needed variables, add them to your dotfiles.
 * On Bash, add them to `~/.bash_profile`.
 * On Zsh, add them to `~/.zprofile` instead.

export JAVA_HOME="/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home"
export EC2_PRIVATE_KEY="$(/bin/ls $HOME/.ec2/pk-*.pem)"
export EC2_CERT="$(/bin/ls $HOME/.ec2/cert-*.pem)"
export EC2_AMITOOL_HOME="/usr/local/Cellar/ec2-ami-tools/1.3-45758/jars"
