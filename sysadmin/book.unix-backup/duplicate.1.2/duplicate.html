Root Mirror: duplicate.sh</font></font></b></center>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>
<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">This script works for Solaris machines
only, but does support multiple Sun architectures.&nbsp; It duplicates
the root disk to another disk using newfs, fsck, and dump.&nbsp; It then
sets the EEPROM settings to automatically boot off that disk the next time
the system is rebooted.</font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Copying the OS</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">To copy the OS, it performs the following
steps:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Partition the copy drive to look the same
as the drive we are booted from</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">newfs the appropriate filesystems on the other
drive</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">fsck the appropriate fileystems on the other
drive</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Use dump/restore to copy the OS over to the
other drive</font></li>

<li>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Modifies the /etc/vfstab to look right on
the other drive</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">This is typically done via cron once a night.&nbsp;
The duplication can be halted if you are planning on an OS upgrade, patch
installation, application installation, or other risky project.&nbsp; If
anything happens to your OS as a result of this project, you can safely
boot off the old disk if you halted the duplication for the length of the
project.</font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Setting the alternate boot</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">duplicate.sh uses the disk aliases (e.g. disk0
disk3) already available.&nbsp; It looks at the disk we are currently booted
from (e.g. disk0), and then sets the boot argument to the other disk (e.g.
boot disk3).&nbsp; That way, the next time the system reboots, it boots
from this disk.&nbsp; This continually tests the process and the other
disk.&nbsp; A neat feature of this is that if the system panics for any
reason, it automatically boots from the other disk when it comes back up.</font>
<h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Don't Forget</font></h2>
<font face="Arial,Helvetica">Remember to disable the duplication process
for a few days any time you are planning an upgrade of any kind.&nbsp;
When you install patches or applications that require a reboot, make sure
you set the boot alias to boot off the drive that you just modified.&nbsp;
Otherwise, you will boot off the alternate disk that was not modified.&nbsp;
Of course, you could also immediately run duplicate.sh, but I wouldn't
advise that.&nbsp; I would make sure that the change didn't negatively
affect your system.</font></td>
