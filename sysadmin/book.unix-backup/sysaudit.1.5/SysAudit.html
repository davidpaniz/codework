<center><b><font size=+2>The SysAudit Utility</font></b>&nbsp;</center>

<p>The SysAudit utility, originally written by Robert Err and updated by
David Young, discovers and records system configuration information such
as:&nbsp;
<ul>
<li>
Disk partitioning information&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Volume manager configuration&nbsp;</li>

<li>
Filesystem configuration&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
It records this information in a file that can later be cross-checked against
the current configuration.&nbsp; If SysAudit detects a change in the configuration,
it can notify you.&nbsp;
<br>Although the SysAudit utility isn’t quite as sophisticated as the SysInfo
utility at <a href="http://www.backupcentral.com">http://www.backupcentral.com</a>,
it does provide information that SysInfo does not.&nbsp; Specifically,
it shows you how your disks are partitioned, which is something that will
come in quite handy if you lose your entire system.&nbsp;</td>
