</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">system:/filesys [system:/filesys]</P><DIR>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are backing up the whole system, it is best to use the option above and have <I>Hostdump.sh</I> figure out which file sytems to back up.

</FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">system1 system2 system3:/filesys system4:filesys</P><DIR>

</B></I></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You can also mix and match the options like this.

Any systems that have a file system listed after them will only have that file system backed up.</P></DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Option 1:  Special Case File Systems</P><DIR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You may have file systems that are listed in the <I>fstab </I>file that you want to exclude on a regular basis.  Or you may want to back up the <I>/tmp</I> file system, which is normally excluded by <I>Hostdump.sh</I>. <I>Hostdump.sh </I>can handle both of these special cases.  If you want to exclude file systems that would normally be included, you put that file systems’s name in a file called </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>fstab</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>.exclude</I>, on the system where you want to exclude it.  (For </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>fstab</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>,</I> you need to substitute whatever that version of UNIX calls the <I>fstab</I> file.  For example, you would use <I>/etc/vfstab.exclude </I>on Solaris.)  To include file systems that are not in the <I>fstab</I> file, or are normally excluded by <I>Hostdump.sh</I>, put that file system’s name in a file called </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>fstab</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>.include</I>, on the system where you want to include it.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For example, assume that on a Solaris system called <I>apollo</I>, you want to exclude the <I>/home</I> file system. Normally it would get backed up since it is in <I>/etc/vfstab</I>.  Suppose that you want to include the <I>/tmp </I>file system.  You would create two files on <I>apollo</I>.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One would be called <I>/etc/vfstab.exclude</I>, and it would contain the entry:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>/home</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second file would be called <I>/etc/vfstab.include</I>, and it would contain the entry:</P>
</FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=1><P>/tmp</P></DIR>

</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Advanced Option 2:  Systems Bigger Than a Tape</P><DIR>

<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hostdump.sh</I>, like the <I>dump</I> and <I>restore</I> commands, was not originally designed with today’s systems in mind.  The script was first written to back up Ultrix systems (the largest of which was 7GB at the time) to 8mm compressed drives (the smallest of which was 10GB).  The original author never envisioned a system where the disk was bigger than a tape.  Then Hostdump.sh (and I) met HP’s that shipped with 20GB of disk and one 6GB DDS tape drive!  Something had to be done.</P></DIR>

<U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The "NOTE" should end here, but the &gt;bullets go outside of it.</P><DIR>

</U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The easiest thing would be to scrap the original idea of looking at the <I>fstab</I>, and give it a list of file systems to back up.  That would be an easy option to include, and the job would get done.  Essentially, that’s what I’ve done, but with a twist.  I recommend doing it in the following manner:</P></DIR>


<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Use Hostdump.sh in the regular manner, excluding enough file systems in </FONT><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>fstab</FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>.exclude, so that what is left will fit on one tape</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Using the advanced option to include the excluded file systems onto another tape or tapes.</LI></P></UL>
<DIR>

<EM><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why is it important to do it this way?</EM>  It goes back to the second essential element of a good backup –intelligence.  Say, for example, that you have only had two include lists.  You tell <I>Hostdump.sh</I> to backup <I>/</I>, <I>/usr</I>, <I>/var</I>, <I>/opt,</I> and <I>/home1</I> on one tape, and <I>/home2</I> and <I>/home3</I> on another.  What happens when you add <I>/home4</I>?  Unless someone or something tells the backup program, it will never get backed up.  You’ll never know it either, until someone asks you to restore <I>/home4/yourboss/really-important-presentation-to-the-board-of-directors.doc</I>.  So, whenever you are in a situation like this, whether you are using this program or not, you need to find a way to back up the entire system on one tape drive (excluding certain file systems), then back up the excluded file systems on another tape.  That way, when you add <I>/home4</I>, it will be automatically included on the first tape.  The worst thing to happen is for the new <I>/home4</I> fills up your first tape <EM>(which you would immediately know because you monitor your backups, right?)</EM>, and you have to manually add it to the second tape and exclude it from the first.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To use this option, run <I>hostdump.sh</I> a second or third time, specifying the file systems that were excluded in </FONT><B><I><FONT FACE="Courier" SIZE=2>fstab</B></FONT><FONT FACE="Times" SIZE=2>.exclude</I>.  It is easier to explain this option with an example. In this example, <I>elvis</I> is the name of the Solaris system you want to back up.  You are using <I>Hostdump.sh</I> for the first time, and you know that a full backup will fit onto three different tapes.  You have divided up the file systems equally in the following manner:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tape 1:  OS file systems (<I>/</I>, <I>/usr</I>, <I>/var</I>, <I>/opt</I>, etc.),<I> /home1</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tape 2: <I>/home2</I>, <I>/home3</I>, <I>/home4</P>
</I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Tape 3: <I>/home5</I>, <I>/home6</P>
