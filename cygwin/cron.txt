It's ok. I configured it to do so.

Try the following:

- Check the NT event log. It could give a hint what's going wrong.

- Set the env var CYGWIN to a defined value containg `ntsec' in the
  service setting:

  cygrunsrv -E cron
  cygrunsrv -R cron
  cygrunsrv -I cron -d "CYGWIN cron" -p /usr/sbin/cron -a -D -e "CYGWIN=tty ntsec"
  cygrunsrv -S cron

- Check your /etc/passwd AND /etc/group files. Perhaps it's better
  to regenerate them using mkpasswd and mkgroup again.

- If you still have problems try the next developers snapshot of
  Cygwin. I checked in a patch today which solves a problem when
  switching user context.
